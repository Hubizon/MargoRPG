MargoRPG, created in 2019 (when I was 14, so donâ€™t judge the code too harshly!), is a simplified version of [Margonem](https://www.margonem.pl/). In this game, you can battle enemies, collect and equip loot, buy new items, and master a skill-based combat system with unique weapon effects.

This project uses graphics from Margonem, with all rights belonging to their respective owners.
